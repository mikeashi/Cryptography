# Keywords

### 1. Plaintext: 
        plaintext is a readable, plain message that anyone can read.

### 2. Ciphertext: 
        Ciphertext is the result of the encryption process. 
        The encrypted plaintext appears as apparently random 
        string of characters, rendering them useless.

### 3. Encryption:
        Encryption is the process of applying a mathematical function
        to a plain message to get the Ciphertext.

### 4. Decryption:
        Decryption is the process of applying the mathematical inverse
        function to Ciphertext to get the plaintext.

### 5. Key:
        The Key is a sequence required in order to preform both
        of the encryption and decryption process.

### 6. Symmetric algorithm:
        Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
        Both parties must agree on the algorithm key before commencing communication.
        
### 7. Asymmetric algorithm:
         Use two different keys: a public key and a private key.
         This enables secure encryption while communicating without previously
         establishing a mutual algorithm. This is also known as public key cryptology.
